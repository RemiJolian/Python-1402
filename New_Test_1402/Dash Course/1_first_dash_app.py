# The debug = True parameter in the app.run_server(debug = True) line, means that
#  the Dash application will run in debug mode. When set to True, it enables debug mode,
# allowing for interactive debugging, reloader, and other development features. This is
# useful during the development phase to identify and fix issues. However, in a production
# environment, it should be set to False for security and performance reasons.
# Debug mode provides a helpful tool for developers to identify and resolve issues during the
#  development of an application. It enables features such as automatic reloading of the server
# when code changes are detected and provides more detailed error messages. However, in a
# production environment, these features can pose security risks and impact performance, 
# so it's important to set debug mode to False when deploying the application.
