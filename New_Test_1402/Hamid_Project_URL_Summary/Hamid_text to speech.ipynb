It allows users to convert text to speech and save it as an MP3 file. The gTTS library offers features such as customizable speech-specific sentence tokenizer, text pre-processors, and support for multiple languages. It is a convenient tool for generating speech from text and is widely used for various applications, including language processing and accessibility. The library can be installed using pip, and it provides both command-line and Python module interfaces for text-to-speech conversion."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# The IPython.display module \n","provides a set of tools for displaying various types of content in IPython environments, such as Jupyter Notebooks.

It can be used with the display() function to play audio files or generate audio from text using libraries like gTTS.\n","IPython.display.Image: This class is used to display images in the IPython environment. It can be used with the display() function to display images from local or remote sources.\n","IPython.display.display_html: This function displays an HTML-formatted string in the IPython environment. It can be used to render HTML tables, charts, or other complex elements that are not supported by the default display() function\n","IPython.display.clear_output: This function clears the output of the current cell in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to display new content without having to restart the kernel.\n","To use the IPython.display module, you need to import the required classes or functions and then use them with the display() function or other supported functions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":93},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":226,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693754047321,"user":{"displayName":"Hamid Bagheri","userId":"15612199602553400274"},"user_tz":300},"id":"6kFpP4-gi789","outputId":"98869263-2594-4178-dc07-0d121e8b0d7d"},"outputs":[],"source":["from gtts import gTTS\n","import IPython.display as ipd\n","\n","# The text you want to convert to speech\n","text = \"Ferdowsi's Shahnameh,\\\n","due to its special and unique place in the literary and  \\\n","cultural history of Iran, has always been present  \\\n","and influential in various fields and fields of life and thought of Iranians.\"\n","\n","# Language in which you want to convert\n","# language = 'en'\n","language = 'en-us' # American accent\n","\n","# Passing the text and language to the engine, slow=False makes the speech faster\n","tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=language, slow=False)\n","\n","# Saving the converted audio in a mp3 file named 'welcome'\n","tts.save(\"welcome.mp3\")\n","\n","# Play the saved file\n","ipd.Audio(\"welcome.mp3\", autoplay=True)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693753697939,"user":{"displayName":"Hamid Bagheri","userId":"15612199602553400274"},"user_tz":300},"id":"IWsq9E6vk9Ut"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# URL of the article you want to summarize\n","# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz\"\n","url = input('Inter your URL')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a\n","Python package for natural language processing.
