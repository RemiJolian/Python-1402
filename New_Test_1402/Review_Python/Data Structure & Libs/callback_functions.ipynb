    "In Python, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed by that function. The purpose of a callback function is to allow the calling function to be more flexible and modular by allowing the caller to specify a function to be executed when a certain event occurs or when a certain condition is met.\n",
    "In Python, callback functions are commonly used in event-driven programming, where the program waits for an event to occur and then executes a callback function in response to that event. For example, in the Dash library, a callback function is executed when an input component's property changes, allowing the output component to be updated in response to the change."

    " The callback function is provided with the new value of the input property as its argument, and Dash updates the property of the output component with whatever is returned by the function. Callbacks can be used to create interactive and dynamic web applications, where changes in one component trigger updates in other parts of the app.\n",
