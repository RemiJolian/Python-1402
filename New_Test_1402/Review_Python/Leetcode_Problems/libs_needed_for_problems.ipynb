    "The itertools.groupby() function in Python is a powerful tool for grouping elements of an iterable based on\n",

    "\n",
    "The groupby() function takes two arguments:\n",
    "The iterable (such as a list, tuple, or dictionary) that you want to group.\n",
    "An optional key function (or callable) that specifies how to check the items as they come out of\n",
    "the iterable.\n",
    "It returns an iterator that gives a two-tuple: the result of the key callable and an iterable\n",
    "containing the grouped items.\n",
    "The items with the same key value end up in the same group.\n",
    "Example:\n",
